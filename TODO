STATISTICS
- Correlations? P533
- Histogram, quantiles, CFD: Generate some data (height?) 100 integers between some range. 
  Then bin then. Then create histogram. Display table and allow student to increase count 
  in some of the bins (in the table represetation (will have a + or minus). Then see the
  histogram and cdf reflect the changes in real time. Also see if Q1 and Q3 change.
  And the mode and the mean, etc?
