- hyperbola 
    - y = a + b/x P599

- Exponential y = ab^x + c P619 

- trigonometric: y = a + bincx (cos and tan too) (p203)
- Graphs of the form y = kexp(nx) + a and y = kln(ax+b) when n, k, a, b are integers (p119)
- |f(x)| where f(x) is
    - linear (a + bx) (p12)
    - quadratic (a + bx + cx^2) (p31)
    - cubic k(x-a)(x-b)(x-c) (p83)
- |f(x)| for f trigonometric (p211)
- circles (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2
- y = ax^n for n = +-1/2 P613

STATISTICS
- Correlations? P533
- Histogram, quantiles, CFD: Generate some data (height?) 100 integers between some range. 
  Then bin then. Then create histogram. Display table and allow student to increase count 
  in some of the bins in the table represetation (will have a + or minus). Then see the
  histogram and cdf reflect the changes in real time. Also see if Q1 and Q3 change.
  And the mode and the mean, etc? 

-----------------
  - Rephrase Section on Toggles
  - information (button) on each tab about polynomials, Hyperbolae, etc.
  - SAME instructions modal for instructions. Just vary the content.
  - Rephrase introduction. E.g. replace "polynomial' with 'graph'.
  - Have a toggle to swap from radians to degrees. This should change just the labels. 
  - Generated PDFs as exercises for users to fit a, b parameters
  - Video of how to use app
  - Translation into other languages
