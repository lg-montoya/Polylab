calculations. The steps involved resembled:

1. Creating a table with two rows: one for $x$ and another for $f(x)$.
2. For each value of $x$, using a calculator to obtain its corresponding 
 $f(x)$ value.
3. Populating the table with the calculated values.
4. Obtaining ruled paper and plotting the coordinates $(x,f(x))$.
5. Connecting all these dots as smoothly as possible.  
6. Changing one of the coefficients in the polynomial, and[$^*$](# "Very deep breath ...") 
repeating steps 1-5 . 

Drawing a quadratic using 7 points would require 42 mathematical operations in my 
head[$^*$](# "21 additions, 14 multiplications, 7 squarings." ), and I'd spend 
90% of my time on step 2[$^*$](# "Great for my mental arithmentic."), 5% 
on step 5, but only 3% 
conceptualising the relationship between coefficients and polynomial shapes[$^*$](# "Which was the exercise's raison d'etre.").
Additionally (and unfortunately), it was not uncommmon for careless mistakes[$^*$](# "Negatives (magically) becoming positives. We've all been there.") to creep into one of the
42 mathematical operations. The sketch of my graph would then look suspect, and I'd spend time[$^*$](# "That's the other 2% went in case the statisticians were wondering.")
 hunting down the error.

And all that work was just for looking at the impact on $f(x)$. If I also wanted to see 
the impact on $f'(x)$, I had to do all that work over 
again[$^*$](# "OK, there's one less term in the calculation, but still ... another deep sigh.").  

Fortunately, the manual calculations can be avoided with the use of this dashboard. We
can now focus on bending/twisting/shifting our polynomial by changing the coefficients.
