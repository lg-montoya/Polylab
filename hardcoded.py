#### Motivation
___
When I began studying polynomials and wanted to 
experiment with them
that process required many manual 
calculations. The steps involved resembled:

1. Creating a table with two rows: one for $x$ and another for $f(x)$.
2. For each value of $x$, using a calculator to obtain its corresponding 
 $f(x)$ value.
3. Populating the table with the calculated values.
4. Obtaining ruled paper and plotting the coordinates $(x,f(x))$.
5. Connecting all these dots as smoothly as possible.  
6. Changing one of the coefficients in the polynomial, and
repeating steps 1-5 . 

Drawing a quadratic using 7 points would require 42 mathematical operations in my 
head, and I'd spend 
90% of my time on step 2, 5% 
on step 5, but only 3% 
conceptualising the relationship between coefficients and polynomial shapes.
Additionally (and unfortunately), it was not uncommmon for careless mistakes to creep into one of the
42 mathematical operations. The sketch of my graph would then look suspect, and I'd spend time
 hunting down the error.

And all that work was just for looking at the impact on $f(x)$. If I also wanted to see 
the impact on $f'(x)$, I had to do all that work over 
again.

Fortunately, the manual calculations can be avoided with the use of this dashboard. We
can now focus on bending/twisting/shifting our polynomial by changing the coefficients.

POLYNOMIAL_INSTRUCTIONS = '''
**Dropdown**  
Begin by choosing from the dropdown the desired polynomial whose form and derivatives 
you wish to explore. The highest order polynomial available is a cubic.

**Sliders**  
They are disabled until a polynomial is selected from the dropdown.
Each polynomial has a different set of coefficients whose values are
adjusted by the sliders. The graphs (and their titles) will reflect the 
coeffiecients' changes.

**Legend**  
Activate and deactivate the traces by single clicking on the legend.
Double-click a trace to isolate it.

**Chart controls**  
At the top right of each chart are a set of controls for the
user to manipulate the chart. Hover over each icon to see its
functionality.

**Other Controls**  
Choose amongst the different amount of grid-lines to display on your graphs.

There are also two toggles at the top right. The first toggle increases 
the width of app if viewed in landscape mode. The second toggle 
changes the skin of the app: colourful marshmallows or 
Witch-king of Angmar.

**COEFFICIENT ORDERING**  
El formulario le ayuda localisar los (casa)lotes dentro del municipio de
 Medellín. *Buscar* sera habilitado solo cuando todos los campos esten llenos.

Vias como *El Palo*, *Carabobo*, *Avenida Las Palmas* etc., se encuentran solo
 con su correspondiente Carrera, Diagonal, etc..

**A LINE! REALLY?**  
Sure why not. Not the most exciting of polynomials, but it is a polynomial
of degree 1.


**CONTINUITY AND SMOOTHNESS FOR DERIVATIVENESS 

La exactitud de los valores en la tabla mejora cuando el lote esta
 completamente dentro la(s) frontera(s). Por ejemplo un lote puede abarcar
 dos *Poligonos de Tratamientos*  en cuyo caso, la tabla exponera información
 solo de uno de esos poligonos. Una inspeción visual del mapa es recomendable
 en esos casos. Valores como *N/A*, *None* corresponde a información
 incompleta.

**A constant**  
Active y desactive capas con el widget de capas al lado superior-derecho del
 mapa. Flote sobre cualquier frontera para ver su valor.
